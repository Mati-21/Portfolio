            I am a Full Stack Software Developer with a strong passion for
            building scalable, user-friendly, and visually engaging
            applications. With expertise in MongoDB, Express.js, React, and
            Node.js (MERN stack), I specialize in developing end-to-end web
            solutions â€” from designing intuitive user interfaces to implementing
            robust backend systems.
            <br /> <br /> I have hands-on experience with modern tools and
            frameworks such as Tailwind CSS for responsive design and Figma for
            UI/UX prototyping, ensuring that every project I work on is both
            functional and visually appealing. <br /> <br />I enjoy solving
            complex problems, optimizing performance, and delivering
            high-quality digital solutions that meet real-world needs. My goal
            is to continuously learn, grow, and contribute to impactful projects
            that make a difference.
